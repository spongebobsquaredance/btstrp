mini weekend project to learn more about Bootstrap

based the typography on the back cover of John Coltrane's 1957 Blue Train album 
(released on Blue Note)

borrowed the h1 title from the book Blue Highways: A Journey into America

used http://www.monocleipsum.com/ for some of the filler text

and fittext.js to make the h1 title flex with the viewport width
